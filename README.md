## Exploring AI-Driven Learning Assistance in Chinese Higher Education: A Multidisciplinary and Regional Analysis of Professional Coursework

### Sentiment Classification and Thematic Analysis

In Sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3, we conducted sentiment classification using a hybrid attention-based architecture that integrates BERT embeddings with a Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) network and an attention mechanism. Specifically, BERT was employed to generate contextualized representations for each clause, which were then processed by a Bi-LSTM layer to capture sequential dependencies in both forward and backward directions. An attention mechanism was subsequently applied to assign greater weight to sentiment-relevant tokens, particularly those expressing emotional valence. Finally, a softmax layer produced a sentiment labelâ€”positive, neutral, or negative.

We are proud to make this implementation available for further academic exploration. If our code proves useful to your research, we would be delighted. For any questions or technical inquiries, please feel free to contact the first author. Should the paper be accepted, we will release additional implementation details and documentation to support reproducibility.

By linking sentiment classification with structured thematic analysis, this study uncovers not temporal fluctuations but systematic variations in student perceptions across educational levels and disciplinary backgrounds. This integrated approach enhances our interpretation of student attitudes by offering both macro-level sentiment distributions and nuanced, context-sensitive insights into how AI-driven learning tools are perceived and utilized in higher education.
